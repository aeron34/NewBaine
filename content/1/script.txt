Ok so, Cryptocurrency...what is Cryptocurrency?

Well I think the best way to answer that question is
to use the definition that wikipeida uses and then simplfy
it further:

"A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership."

So basically A crypto is a completely digital form of payment whose integretity, 
meaning it's inability to be forged and faked, is mantained by mathematical
algorithms and a community with no central authority. The latter part of the simplification
is why you hear the word Decentralized thrown around so much.

Now that's what a cryptocurrency is, but what about how to trade them? Well this 
is where an exchange comes in. An exchange is so simple it almost needs no introduction,
but I'll give one anyway. An exchange is just where people buy and sell cryptocurrencies.

Now we could go over all the exchanges but that would take too much time, so here
are my favorites:

	- Coinbase,

	- Kraken,

	- Okex

And KuCoin, and my favorite wallet BY FAR is Atomic wallet.

and what exchanges are, let's move on to the next topic...
